UPDATE: ALTERNATIVE METHOD
Just run the registry editor (.reg) file `disable_windows_key` and restart the computer. To revert changes, do the same but with the other file. This makes sure Easy AntiCheat does not target you and avoids potential bans.

-- OLD METHOD DESCRIPTION BELOW --
This is a very simple program to disable the super key in windows.
It was too annoying accidentally pressing it while playing Fortnite ^w^
Just run ds.exe or compile it yourself:

g++ -o ds disable_super_keyUI.cpp -lgdi32 -mwindows

cheers!
